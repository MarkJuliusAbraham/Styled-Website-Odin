# Styled-Website-Odin
## A webpage for learning purposes. Includes CSS.

This is a landing page made using **HTML and CSS**. It was done as part of the OdinProject learning chapters on CSS.
I made this to re-learn both HTML and CSS fundamentals from the ground-up.

### Here is an image of the landing page on the regular screen resolution:

And as part of properly-learning the fundamentals. The page is adaptive to screen-sizes as the flexbox technique is used for nearly everything.

### Bigger screen resolution:

### Smaller screen resolution:

<br></br>  
However, it should be noted that the webpage is not *fully* adaptive. Specifically, text-sizes do not adapt appropriately to screen resolution,
the navigation bar does not collapse into a drop-down menu for mobile viewing, and images fully shrink when the screen is too small. This is because JavaScript was not used for this particular project. 

## The following are images to showcase the rest of the webpage:
